# Requester

A lightweight async/await and Combine based networking library.

TODO list:
- Fix processors / authenticators to be type only, so that the lifecycle is handled by the api requester with a dictionary, instead of spawning many of them due to every backend creating a new one.
- Ensure you are able to fully throw your own errors with the response processor (not having requester throw one before you have the chance)
